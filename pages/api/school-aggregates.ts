/**
 * SCHOOL AGGREGATES API ENDPOINT
 * 
 * PURPOSE: This endpoint provides all aggregate data for a school in a single API call.
 * It's the primary data source for the application's high-performance data display.
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE STRATEGY: Uses materialized views instead of real-time calculations.
 * This provides sub-second response times even with millions of data points.
 * 
 * DATA RETURNED:
 * - School-wide aggregates (overall metrics)
 * - Curriculum-specific aggregates (filtered by curriculum)
 * - Collection-specific aggregates (filtered by collection)
 * - Course-specific aggregates (filtered by course)
 * - Chapter-specific aggregates (filtered by chapter)
 * - Student-level aggregates (for student selector)
 * - Cohort-specific versions of all the above (for cohort switching)
 * 
 * MATERIALIZED VIEWS USED:
 * - mv_school_unfiltered_aggregates: Overall school metrics
 * - mv_school_curriculum_aggregates: Metrics by curriculum
 * - mv_school_collection_aggregates: Metrics by collection
 * - mv_school_course_aggregates: Metrics by course
 * - mv_school_chapter_aggregates: Metrics by chapter
 * - mv_student_unfiltered_aggregates: Student-level aggregates
 * - mv_cohort_*_aggregates: Cohort-specific versions
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: This endpoint returns pre-calculated summaries, not individual records.
 * For individual student data, use the /api/student-data endpoint instead.
